Project name is a `Random Password Generator` that allows `the user` to do `generate a random password based on input prompts`.

This project focuses on logic, loops, functions, building strings one character at a time, and random numbers. 
The basic premis is to have a password generate after the user chooses the length and which character sets are to be included.

## Things I leared:
A ton... i know that generic but i wrote many functions and used many different things than I had before.
- I borrowed this readme file template from 
- building a string in a while loop and for loop
- building an array in a while loop and for loop
- calling functions
- returning values from functions.
- \ special character... i left this for 2nd to last. I got hung up on it for a minute but got figured it out in the end. 
- this readme file. i think it is better than my previous.
- tons of alerts for debugging and proper code execution validation.
    + yes i know console log does this but i liked using alert.. 
- psuedo code. extremely important for this one.. I wrote about half the code then stopped and spent time figuring out the random number loop.. How to choose which Character set to start the string with and then how to choose the character inside the array for the next character in the password.. how to do all this in such a way so that it works inside a loop and extra code isn't required to start or end the loop.

# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Your Task

This week’s homework requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
